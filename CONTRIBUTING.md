## Development setup

Install [Pixi](https://pixi.sh), then:

```bash
pixi install -e dev && pixi run -e dev post_install
```

This gives you R, Python, Quarto, knitr, reticulate, and every package used in
the book. The `post_install` step compiles a handful of CRAN packages (brms,
rstanarm, bayesplot, keras3, dcurves, EValue, CMAverse) that are not available
on conda-forge.

## Previewing and rendering

```bash
pixi run -e dev preview   # live-reload dev server
pixi run -e dev render    # full render to _book/
```

The book uses `freeze: true`, so Quarto reuses cached outputs from `_freeze/`
instead of re-executing every code chunk. If you edit a code chunk, the freeze
cache for that chunk is invalidated and Quarto will try to re-execute it (and
every chunk it depends on). Since the `book` environment only has the rendering
toolchain (no chapter packages), always use `dev` when editing code:

```bash
pixi run -e dev render                                    # re-execute changed chunks + render
pixi run -e dev render chapters/ml_explainability.qmd   # single chapter
```

Once the freeze cache is up-to-date, the lightweight `book` environment works
for preview:

```bash
pixi run easy_render    # fast render from _freeze/ (book env, no re-execution)
pixi run easy_preview   # live-reload from _freeze/ (book env)
```

To force a chapter to re-execute from scratch:

```bash
rm -rf _freeze/chapters/<chapter_name>
pixi run -e dev render
```

## Adding or editing a chapter

1. Create a `.qmd` file in `chapters/` (or `advanced/` for the advanced
   toolkit).
2. Register it in `_quarto.yml` under the appropriate `part:`.
3. Use `scripts/common.R` or `scripts/common.py` at the top of your code blocks
   for shared themes, palettes, and data loaders.
4. Add exercise solutions to `solutions/`.
5. Preview locally before pushing.

## Modifying dependencies

- Edit `pixi.toml`. Use bounded version specifiers (e.g. `">=1.2,<2"`), not
  `"*"`.
- If the package is needed by standalone-R users (no Pixi), also add it to
  `scripts/install_packages.R`.
- Push your changes -- the `check-envs.yml` workflow will test all four
  environment arms automatically.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers the `publish.yml` workflow, which installs the
lightweight `book` pixi environment, renders the book from `_freeze/`, and
deploys `_book/` to GitHub Pages.

Workflow:

1. Commit `_freeze/` changes (if any chapters were re-executed)
2. Push to `main`
