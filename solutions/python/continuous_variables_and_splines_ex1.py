# --- Question (a) ---
# What assumptions does categorising SBP into Normal (<120), Elevated (120-129),
# Stage 1 HTN (130-139), Stage 2 HTN (>=140) impose?
#
# ANSWER:
# 1. Within each category, the relationship between SBP and stroke risk is FLAT.
#    A patient with SBP=121 is treated identically to SBP=129.
# 2. At category boundaries, there is a SUDDEN JUMP in risk.
#    SBP=129 and SBP=130 are treated as fundamentally different despite only
#    1 mmHg difference.
# 3. The cut-points (120, 130, 140) are assumed to be biologically meaningful
#    boundaries, which may not reflect the true continuous biology.

# --- Question (b) ---
# A patient with SBP 131 is classified the same as SBP 139. Why is this problematic?
#
# ANSWER:
# The difference of 8 mmHg (131 vs 139) is clinically substantial. In reality,
# stroke risk increases with higher SBP. By lumping these patients together,
# we lose the ability to distinguish their different risk levels. The patient
# at 139 mmHg (close to Stage 2) likely has meaningfully higher stroke risk
# than the patient at 131 mmHg, but the categorised model assigns them
# identical predicted risk. This information loss reduces statistical power
# and can bias effect estimates.

# --- Question (c) ---
# Suggest a better modelling approach.
#
# ANSWER:
# Use a restricted cubic spline (RCS) with 3-5 knots to model SBP as a
# continuous predictor. This:
#   - Preserves the full information in SBP
#   - Allows the relationship to be non-linear (capturing any steepening
#     at higher pressures)
#   - Constrains the curve to be linear in the tails (sensible extrapolation)
#   - Uses only k-1 degrees of freedom for k knots (parsimonious)

# --- Supporting demonstration ---
# Simulate data to visually compare categorised vs spline approaches
