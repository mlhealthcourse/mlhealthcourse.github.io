Note on AI-specific items:
AI-specific items (AI-1 through AI-3) are not applicable because this
capstone uses logistic regression, not machine learning. If a gradient
boosted model or neural network were used, these items would require:
  - AI-1: Feature engineering pipeline, normalization, encoding
  - AI-2: Hyperparameter search strategy (grid, random, Bayesian)
  - AI-3: SHAP values, partial dependence plots, or LIME explanations

The TRIPOD+AI checklist is available from the EQUATOR Network:
https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-ai/

Key points for completing TRIPOD+AI:
1. NEVER report AUROC/C-statistic without calibration
2. Always include a calibration plot
3. Fairness assessment across demographic subgroups is now required
4. Code and data availability statements are mandatory
5. For AI/ML models, explainability methods must be described
