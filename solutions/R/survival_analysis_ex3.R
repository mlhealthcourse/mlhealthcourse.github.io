# Chapter 6, Exercise 3: Competing Risks Thinking
# Kidney transplant rejection with death as a competing risk
# =============================================================================
# This exercise is primarily conceptual (parts 1-2) with a bonus coding
# component (part 3).

# --- Question 1 ---
# Explain why treating death as censoring would bias the results.
# What direction would the bias go?
#
# ANSWER:
# Treating death as simple censoring VIOLATES the assumption of
# NON-INFORMATIVE censoring. Non-informative censoring means that
# censored patients have the same future risk of the event as those
# who remain under observation. But patients who die are NOT like
# patients who remain alive -- they have ZERO future risk of rejection
# (because dead patients cannot experience rejection).
#
# The bias direction: treating death as censoring INFLATES (overestimates)
# the estimated probability of rejection. This happens because the
# Kaplan-Meier estimator assumes that censored patients would eventually
# experience the event at the same rate as those still at risk. But dead
# patients will NEVER experience rejection, so acting as if they could
# leads to an overestimate of the cumulative incidence of rejection.
#
# In the KM framework, when a patient dies and is "censored," they are
# removed from the risk set, effectively assuming they would have had
# the same rejection rate as surviving patients. Since they actually
# have zero rejection risk, this inflates the estimated rate.

# --- Question 2 ---
# Which approach for estimating probability of rejection within 2 years:
# cause-specific hazards or Fine-Gray?
#
# ANSWER:
# For estimating the PROBABILITY of rejection within 2 years, use the
# FINE-GRAY subdistribution hazard model. Here is why:
#
# - Cause-specific hazards model the RATE of rejection among those
#   currently alive and rejection-free. This answers: "Among patients
#   still alive, what is the instantaneous risk of rejection?" This is
#   useful for understanding ETIOLOGY (what causes rejection).
#
# - The Fine-Gray model directly models the CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE
#   FUNCTION, which gives the probability of rejection by time t,
#   accounting for the fact that some patients will die first. This
#   is the right quantity for PREDICTION and CLINICAL COMMUNICATION.
#
# When your goal is prediction ("What is the probability that this
# patient's transplant will be rejected within 2 years?"), you need
# the cumulative incidence, which properly accounts for the competing
# risk of death. The Fine-Gray model provides this directly.
