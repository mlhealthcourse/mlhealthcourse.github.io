    # 1. Title
    "'Development and external validation of a logistic regression model
    for predicting 10-year cardiovascular disease risk: a Framingham-NHANES
    study.' Identifies study type (development + external validation) and
    modelling approach.",

    # 2. Abstract
    "Structured abstract with: objective, study design, data sources,
    outcome (10-year CVD), predictors, sample sizes, C-statistic and
    calibration results for both development and validation cohorts.",

    # 3a. Background
    "Existing CVD risk models (Framingham, QRISK, SCORE2) and their
    limitations. Gap: need for updated validation in contemporary US
    population.",

    # 3b. Objectives
    "To develop a 10-year CVD risk prediction model using Framingham
    data and externally validate it in NHANES 2017-2020.",

    # 4a. Source of data
    "Development: Framingham Heart Study teaching dataset (riskCommunicator
    R package). Validation: NHANES 2017-2020 (nhanesA package). Both are
    publicly available.",

    # 4b. Dates
    "Framingham: original cohort with follow-up through 2005. NHANES:
    2017-2020 survey cycles.",

    # 5a. Eligibility
    "Adults aged 30-74, free of CVD at baseline, with complete data on
    key predictors. Exclude prior MI, stroke, heart failure.",

    # 5b. Treatments
    "Not applicable (prediction model, not treatment comparison).
    However, blood pressure treatment status is included as a predictor.",

    # 6a. Outcome definition
    "10-year cardiovascular event: composite of MI, coronary death,
    stroke, or heart failure requiring hospitalisation.",

    # 6b. Outcome timing
    "10-year follow-up from baseline examination. Censored at death
    from non-CVD causes or loss to follow-up.",

    # 6c. Blinding
    "Not applicable for retrospective analysis. Outcome ascertainment
    in Framingham was by adjudication committee blinded to risk factors.",

    # 7. Predictors
    "Pre-specified based on established Framingham model: age, sex, total
    cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure
    treatment status, smoking, diabetes. No data-driven selection.",

    # 8. Sample size
    "Sample size justified using Riley et al. (2020) criteria via
    pmsampsize package: 8 predictors, anticipated outcome prevalence 10%,
    target R-squared 0.15, requiring minimum ~800 events.",

    # 9. Missing data
    "Development cohort: <5% missing. Validation: up to 12% for some
    laboratory values. Handled by multiple imputation (MICE, 50 datasets,
    20 iterations). Complete-case sensitivity analysis performed.",

    # 10a. Model development
    "Logistic regression for 10-year risk. Pre-specified predictors,
    no variable selection. Continuous predictors modelled with restricted
    cubic splines (4 knots for age and SBP; 3 knots for cholesterol)
    based on prior literature.",

    # 10b. Model specification
    "Full model equation provided in supplementary materials. Coefficients
    table with 95% CIs in main text.",

    # 10c. Predictor selection
    "All predictors pre-specified from clinical knowledge. No stepwise
    selection. Rationale provided for each predictor.",

    # 10d. Performance measures
    "Discrimination: C-statistic (Harrell's concordance) with 95% CI.
    Calibration: calibration plot (observed vs predicted), calibration
    slope, calibration-in-the-large. Both reported for development
    (bootstrap-corrected) and external validation.",

    # 11. Risk groups
    "Patients categorised into low (<5%), moderate (5-10%), high (10-20%),
    and very high (>20%) 10-year CVD risk groups. Classification tables
    provided.",

    # 12a. Internal validation
    "500 bootstrap resamples for optimism-corrected C-statistic and
    calibration slope. Apparent and corrected performance reported.",

    # 12b. External validation
    "Model applied to NHANES data without recalibration. C-statistic
    and calibration plot in external data. Recalibration of intercept
    also explored.",

    # 13. Fairness
    "C-statistic and calibration reported separately by sex (male/female)
    and by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black,
    Hispanic, Asian). Differences in performance >0.05 C-statistic
    flagged for discussion.",

    # 14. Participants
    "Flow diagram showing sample selection: patients screened, excluded
    (with reasons), and included in development and validation cohorts.
    Table 1 with baseline characteristics stratified by CVD status.",

    # 15. Model development
    "Full regression table with coefficients, standard errors, odds
    ratios, 95% CIs, and p-values. Presented as Table 2.",

    # 16. Model performance
    "Table 3: discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration metrics for
    development (apparent and corrected) and external validation.
    Figures: calibration plots (development and validation), decision
    curve analysis.",

    # 17. Model updating
    "Recalibration of intercept in NHANES improved calibration-in-the-
    large from X to Y. Full model updating was explored but not
    recommended due to limited improvement.",

    # 18. Interpretation
    "Model performance compared with published Framingham, QRISK3, and
    PCE models. Clinical utility assessed via decision curve analysis
    across clinically relevant threshold probabilities (5-20%).",

    # 19. Limitations
    "Limitations discussed: (1) Framingham cohort may not represent
    contemporary diverse populations; (2) NHANES validation limited by
    shorter follow-up and self-reported outcomes; (3) Missing data
    assumptions; (4) Ecological fallacy in subgroup performance
    assessment.",

    # 20. Implications
    "Clinical implications for CVD risk assessment. Recommendation for
    recalibration before use in non-US populations. Need for prospective
    validation.",

    # 21. Code and data
    "R code provided via GitHub repository [URL]. Framingham data
    available via riskCommunicator package. NHANES data publicly available.
    Reproducible via renv for package management.",

    # AI-1. Data preprocessing
    "Not applicable (logistic regression, not ML/AI). However, data
    cleaning steps, outlier handling, and transformation of predictors
    (restricted cubic splines) described in supplement.",

    # AI-2. Hyperparameter tuning
    "Not applicable for logistic regression. Number of knots for RCS
    pre-specified based on Harrell's recommendations.",

    # AI-3. Model explainability
    "Not applicable (logistic regression is inherently interpretable).
    Coefficient interpretation provided. Nomogram included for clinical
    use.",

    # AI-4. Software
    "R version 4.4.1. Packages: rms (v6.8), survival (v3.7), mice
    (v3.16), gtsummary (v1.7), pmsampsize (v1.1), riskCommunicator
