## Who it is for

Researchers who know basic statistics (means, t-tests, maybe some regression)
and want to learn the methods they see in current medical journals: splines,
penalised regression, prediction models, Bayesian analysis, gradient boosting,
and deep learning.

Everything uses clinical data. Every exercise works in **R** and **Python**.
Pick one or try both.

## Key features

- Bilingual R/Python code throughout
- Clinical examples in every chapter
- Exercises with starter code
- Current references (2024--2026) from BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, Nature Medicine
- TRIPOD+AI reporting guidance
- Journal-ready analysis capstone

## Running locally

The project uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) to manage all dependencies (Quarto, R,
Python packages). Install pixi, then:

```bash
# Python-only students
pixi install && pixi run render

# Python + R students
pixi install -e full && pixi run -e full render

# Contributors (full dev tooling)
pixi install -e dev && pixi run -e dev render
```
